# MEET the blogger

*Paving the roads with good intentions*

Some call me “Carl.” I am the blogger behind the keys. I am a semi-retired teacher of language arts and a small business owner, a husband, a stepdad, and an uncle extraordinaire, a chef, a writer, a packer of gift boxes, a deliverer of parcels, and a former managing editor of Texas’ oldest weekly publication. I rather enjoy creative ventures and learning new things. I have particular interests in the unusual and strange, the mythical and unknown, and the historical and genealogical.
 
It is my hope that the [CACHE51](http://www.cache51.com/) blog will become a distinct assortment of ballyhoo about the things I find interesting and my experiences with them. And, who knows – maybe along the way I will create something of interest to you and worth your visit here.
 
Enjoy your stay, and feel welcomed to drop me a line or two. Thank you for stopping by!
